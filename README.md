### PROJECT TITLE: Predict Student's Dropout and Acadamic Success

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to ...

### Problem Statement

To predict the academic success of students.

### Solution

Machine learning model that will help to predict the dropouts and academic success of the students.

### Repository Structure
[Link to the Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention)

The repository contains the following files:

data.csv: This dataset provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. It includes demographic data, social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment, such as application mode, marital status, course chosen and more. Additionally, this data can be used to estimate overall student performance at the end of each semester by assessing curricular units credited/enrolled/evaluated/approved as well as their respective grades.
app.py:Detailes of the notebook can be find here.
requirements.txt: dependencies that need to be installed.

### Getting Started

To get started with our project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
